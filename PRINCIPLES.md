# Principles

How we decide. These are non-negotiable; changing one is an explicit edit to this file, approved by
the user.

## 1. Writers First, Always

**Principle:** Every decision optimizes for the writer's experience, not the developer's convenience.

**This means:**
- Simple beats powerful when they conflict.
- Web-based contribution beats feature-rich local tooling.
- Clear, actionable messages beat technical diagnostics.
- Writer documentation is written for writers, not engineers.

**Trade-offs we accept:** some advanced interactive fiction features are harder to build; technical
users may find the workflow limiting.

**Examples:**
- Yes: edit `.twee` files directly in the GitHub web UI. No: require a local Tweego install.
- Yes: a generated passage index page. No: writers tracking passage names by hand.

---

## 2. Automation Over Gatekeeping

**Principle:** Quality comes from tooling, not from manual review gates or restrictive permissions.
Automation advises; writers edit; a bot never changes a writer's words on a writer's branch.

**This means:**
- Automate what can be automated; give feedback, not barriers.
- Checks report. They never rewrite a writer's files or commit to a writer's branch, with one
  exception: the formatting linter commits its fixes, which change only whitespace and quote
  characters (never inside Harlowe macros or links) and never wording. No other automation writes
  to a pull request branch.
- An AI finding is advice. A writer decides whether to fix it or dismiss it.
- Trust contributors; verify with tooling.

**Trade-offs we accept:** build infrastructure to maintain; occasional false positives, which
writers dismiss; a bot formatting commit on a writer's branch, which the writer's next edit builds
on.

**Examples:**
- Yes: AI review on every pull request. No: senior-author approval before merge.
- Yes: the linter pushes its whitespace and quote fixes to the branch. No: a bot commits a cache, a
  generated file, AI state or a wording change to the branch.

## 3. Fast Feedback Loops

**Principle:** Time from idea to feedback is measured in minutes, not hours or days.

**This means:**
- Every push builds, previews and runs the structure check.
- AI review starts on its own after the build.
- By default, review reads only what changed; the whole story is reviewed on request.
- Status is visible while work is running.

**Trade-offs we accept:** compute and token cost, bounded by the monthly spend cap
([PRIORITIES.md](PRIORITIES.md)); fast pipelines need ongoing attention.

**Examples:**
- Yes: GitHub Actions on every push. No: nightly batch builds.
- Yes: review the changed passages with the routes that lead to them. No: re-review the whole story
  on every push.

---

## 4. Multiple Perspectives, Same Source

**Principle:** Different tasks need different views of the same content. Generate every view from
one source of truth.

**This means:**
- One `src/` of Twee, many generated outputs, each built for one use.
- Never maintain a parallel copy by hand.
- Add a view only when it serves a clear need.

**Trade-offs we accept:** a more complex build; format-specific bugs.

**Examples:**
- Yes: play, proofread, graph, all-paths and passage pages built from `src/`. No: one output trying
  to serve every purpose.
- Yes: the AI reads generated story context. No: pasting passages into prompts by hand.

---

## 5. Transparency and Inspectability

**Principle:** Writers can always see what happened and why. A failure is always visible; a check
that could not run says so.

**This means:**
- "No issues" is only ever a verified result.
- Every AI finding quotes the text that disagrees and names the passages.
- Every AI result says what was read, by which model, and at what cost.
- One comment per check type per pull request, edited in place.

**Trade-offs we accept:** more red checks, because an outage shows as a failure rather than as
quiet; more verbose output.

**Examples:**
- Yes: "could not review: runner offline" with a failed check. No: an empty comment or a green check
  when the AI did not run.
- Yes: a finding with two quotes and two passage names. No: a generic "continuity issue".

---

## 6. Incremental Progress Over Perfection

**Principle:** Ship improvements iteratively. Working now beats perfect later.

**This means:**
- Start with basic functionality; improve from real usage, not hypothetical pain.
- Optimize common paths; tolerate rough edges in rare cases.
- Learn from what shipped, not from what was planned.

**Trade-offs we accept:** some inconsistency while systems evolve; occasional breaking changes when
we learn a better approach.

**Examples:**
- Yes: tune prompts through November against the eval story. No: hold the AI back until it is
  perfect.
- Yes: ship the Continuity Editor with earlier passages only if the Story Bible is not ready. No:
  hold the Continuity Editor for the Story Bible.

---

## 7. Smart Defaults, Escape Hatches

**Principle:** The default path works for most cases. Escape hatches cover the rest.

**This means:**
- Zero configuration produces good results.
- Advanced options exist but are never required.

**Trade-offs we accept:** some duplication between the simple and advanced paths; advanced options
may be less polished.

**Examples:**
- Yes: review of changed passages runs automatically. No: writers choose a mode on every pull request.
- Yes: `/check-continuity all` for a whole-story read on request. No: a separate command per mode.
- Yes: correct the Story Bible by editing one text file in the web UI. No: correcting it requires a
  developer.

---

## 8. Spend Tokens, Not Writer Minutes

**Principle:** Model tokens are cheap; a writer's attention in November is not. Spend tokens to save
writer minutes, within the monthly spend cap.

**This means:**
- AI review runs automatically; writers do not have to ask for it or wait on it.
- Managed inference beats a machine someone has to keep alive.
- Cost is cut by better prompts and sending only what is needed, never by quietly skipping review.
- The cap is hard. When it is reached, review says it did not run (see the Constraints in
  [PRIORITIES.md](PRIORITIES.md)).

**Trade-offs we accept:** a monthly bill up to the cap; late in an expensive month, a pull request may
get no AI read.

**Examples:**
- Yes: read each changed passage with its routes and a compact slice of canon. No: resend the whole
  Story Bible with every route.
- Yes: stop at the cap and say so. No: raise the cap automatically.

---

## 9. Less, Kept True

**Principle:** Keep fewer documents, features and moving parts, and keep every one of them accurate.
What is not kept true is fixed or deleted.

**This means:**
- One home per fact; documents describe the current state.
- A feature writers do not use is removed, not maintained.
- Every part that must be alive in November has a failure a writer can see.
- A test that cannot fail is deleted or fixed.

**Trade-offs we accept:** things get deleted that someone might want later; git history is the
archive.

**Examples:**
- Yes: delete a feature nobody used last season. No: keep it "just in case".
- Yes: one link parser. No: six that disagree.

---

## Applying these principles

The principles rank in the order above: Writers First, Automation, Fast Feedback, Multiple
Perspectives, Transparency, Incremental, Smart Defaults, Spend Tokens, Less Kept True.

**When they conflict:** Writers First wins. An honest "could not check" beats a fast or flattering
answer. The spend cap beats Spend Tokens. Fast Feedback beats perfection. Transparency beats
simplicity.

## Strategic decision: pull requests are the writer's interface

- Writers commit through the GitHub web UI, see results in pull request comments and the preview,
  and run the few on-demand commands as pull request comments (see the Writer's Guide on the site).
- Writer documentation has one home, the Writer's Guide on the site, read alongside the GitHub web
  UI. Every other document in the repository, Claude docs included, is written for the organiser and
  developer and never carries writer material.
- Writers never install tools, run commands, or run Claude in the repository.
- The `nanoif` CLI is a developer tool. It is not documented in writer guides and is not a supported
  way to contribute.
- Feature notes describe pull-request workflows; error messages point writers to pull request
  comments, never to the CLI.

## What we do not optimize for

- Technical elegance over the writer's experience
- Feature completeness over time to value
- Flexibility over focused functionality
- Supporting every possible workflow
- Beautiful code over working software
- Comprehensive design documents over shipping

These are not bad; they are not what this project optimizes for.
